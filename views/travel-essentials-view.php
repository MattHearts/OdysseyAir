        <h2 style="color:#12bbc7;">Baggage Information</h2>
        <p>
        You may carry on board one piece of hand luggage free of charge, 
        as long as it weighs no more than 10kg and is no larger than 56cm x 45cm x 25cm, 
        including any wheels and handles. If your hand luggage weighs more or is larger than this, it will need to be checked into the aircraft hold, and you may have to pay an additional charge.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color:#12bbc7;">Passports and Visas</h2>
        <p>
            A valid passport is required for international travel. 
            Ensure your passport has at least six months' validity from the date of return. 
            Some countries may require a visa for entry. Check the visa requirements for your destination and apply in advance if necessary.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color:#12bbc7;">Travel Insurance</h2>
        <p>
            We recommend purchasing travel insurance to protect yourself against unforeseen events such 
            as trip cancellations, medical emergencies, or lost baggage. Review the coverage options and choose a 
            plan that best suits your needs.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color:#12bbc7;">Health and Vaccinations</h2>
        <p>
            Check for any required or recommended vaccinations for your destination and ensure 
            you are up-to-date with routine vaccinations. Carry any necessary medications and a copy 
            of your prescriptions while traveling.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color:#12bbc7;">Currency and Payments</h2>
        <p>
            Familiarize yourself with the local currency of your destination. 
            Notify your bank of your travel plans to avoid any issues with using your debit or credit cards abroad. 
            Carry some local currency for small purchases and emergencies.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color:#12bbc7;">Electrical Adapters</h2>
        <p>
            Different countries may have varying electrical socket types. 
            Bring the appropriate travel adapter to charge your electronic devices safely.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color:#12bbc7;">Emergency Contacts</h2>
        <p>
            Save important emergency contacts, including local emergency services and 
            the contact information of your country's embassy or consulate in your destination country.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color:#12bbc7;">Local Customs and Laws</h2>
        <p>
            Familiarize yourself with the local customs and laws of your destination to ensure you 
            respect local traditions and stay on the right side of the law.
